# üîê Security Policy - PatchPilot AI

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

PatchPilot is designed with **privacy-first, security-by-design** principles. Our desktop application prioritizes local processing, user data protection, and secure code execution while maintaining transparency about security practices.

## üèóÔ∏è Security Architecture

### üîí Data Privacy & Local Processing
- **Offline-First Design**: All AI processing happens locally using Ollama models
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Code analysis and AI interactions occur entirely on your device
- **Zero Telemetry**: No usage tracking, analytics, or data collection
- **Explicit File Access**: Only processes files you explicitly upload or select
- **Local Storage**: All chat history and settings stored locally using browser storage APIs

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Code Execution Safety

#### Sandboxed Execution Environment
- **Isolated Subprocess**: All code execution happens in separate, isolated processes
- **Timeout Controls**: Strict execution timeouts prevent infinite loops and resource exhaustion
- **Temporary Directories**: Code runs in temporary, isolated directories that are automatically cleaned
- **Limited Permissions**: Execution environment has restricted access to system resources

#### Supported Languages & Safety Measures
```python
# Safe execution with timeout and isolation
subprocess.run(
    command,
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    timeout=timeout,
    cwd=isolated_temp_directory
)
```

### üßπ Input Sanitization & Validation

#### HTML Content Security
- **HTML Sanitization**: All markdown and user content sanitized before rendering
- **Script Tag Removal**: Automatic removal of `<script>` tags and dangerous content
- **Event Handler Stripping**: All `onclick` and similar event handlers removed
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy and sanitization prevent cross-site scripting

```javascript
// sanitizeHTML.js implementation
export function sanitizeHTML(html) {
  const template = document.createElement('template');
  template.innerHTML = html;
  
  // Remove script tags and event handlers
  const scripts = template.content.querySelectorAll('script');
  scripts.forEach(s => s.remove());
  
  const elements = template.content.querySelectorAll('*');
  elements.forEach(el => {
    [...el.attributes].forEach(attr => {
      if (attr.name.startsWith('on')) {
        el.removeAttribute(attr.name);
      }
    });
  });
  
  return template.innerHTML;
}
```

### üîê Tauri Security Framework

#### Application Permissions
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only required capabilities enabled in Tauri configuration
- **File System Access**: Limited to user-selected files and directories
- **Network Isolation**: No automatic network access except for optional update checks
- **API Restrictions**: Restricted access to sensitive system APIs

#### Security Configuration
```json
{
  "app": {
    "security": {
      "csp": null  // Controlled by application-level sanitization
    }
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "fs": "user-selected-files-only",
    "shell": "sandboxed-execution-only"
  }
}
```

## üåê Network Security

### Update Mechanism
- **GitHub-Only**: Updates fetched exclusively from official GitHub releases
- **User-Initiated**: Update checks only when user explicitly requests
- **Dismissible**: Users can disable update notifications permanently
- **Verification**: Release signatures and checksums verified before installation

### Optional Internet Access
- **Explicit Opt-In**: Internet access for AI research requires user activation
- **Transparent Usage**: Clear indication when internet features are active
- **Controlled Scope**: Limited to educational/research content fetching
- **No Background Requests**: No silent network activity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations & Best Practices

### For Users
- **Code Review**: Always review AI-generated code before execution
- **Trusted Sources**: Only analyze code from trusted sources
- **Local Models**: Keep Ollama models updated for security patches
- **File Permissions**: Be mindful of file access permissions when uploading projects

### For Developers
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates for all dependencies
- **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security review

## üö® Threat Model

### Mitigated Risks
‚úÖ **Code Injection**: Prevented by sandboxed execution and input sanitization  
‚úÖ **XSS Attacks**: Blocked by HTML sanitization and CSP  
‚úÖ **Data Exfiltration**: No network access without explicit user permission  
‚úÖ **Malicious Code**: Isolated execution environment with timeouts  
‚úÖ **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Regular security updates and monitoring  

### Residual Risks
‚ö†Ô∏è **Malicious Local Models**: Users responsible for Ollama model integrity  
‚ö†Ô∏è **File System Access**: Application can access files explicitly shared by user  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Resource Exhaustion**: Large file analysis may consume significant CPU/memory
